			<h1>Buy And Sell Cars</h1>
			<h2>How To Buy And Sell Cars</h2>
			<p>The way we trade new and used cars in the United Kingdom has very much changed over the last few years and probably for the better.</p>
			<p>The days of putting small ads in the local print press and waiting for the telephone to ring have long gone. We are no longer content to visit a private address and stand next to a car we are buying or selling and haggle over condition and price.</p>
			<p>Whether this is because of a modern reluctance to engage with strangers or whether we simply cannot be bothered to go to all that trouble is not clear. We seem not to be too worried about extracting the maximum price when selling any more; we just want a change of vehicle.</p>

			<div class="im-left">

			<div class="im-right">
				<h2>The Private Sale</h2>
				<p>Obviously, some people still do choose to sell their cars privately but these days it is usually via online or national marketplaces. This will ultimately mean that the deal will be done at a private address but this is arguably the best way to get the best cash return on the sale. We also buy cars in this way, searching the listing to find the right model.-</p>

				<p>There are dangers inherent in buying and selling privately however. We do not know who we are dealing with and there are plenty of criminals out there ready to exploit the unwary. It certainly helps to know how to inspect a vehicle for sale. Too many buyers get sold a bad example simply because they do not understand what they are looking at.
				</p>

				<p>Never, ever, meet a buyer or seller at unknown places. Always ensure it is at a private address. Never give cash deposits and only accept a car when it has been thoroughly road-tested and inspected.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>Alternatively, it is a good idea to use a trusted nation-wide website to contact other buyers and sellers. When selling it is often as simple as entering the vehicle registration number and letting the system do the rest. Private buyers and dealers are always searching for good cars. These sites are also an easy way to seek out just the right car to buy and it is a great way to find great deals.</p>

				<h2>Online Commercial Buyers And dealers</h2>
				<p>The last decade has seen a rise in companies who commit to buying a car from you for a guaranteed price, subject to inspection. This is the easy way to sell a car. These businesses are generally clear that a seller will not receive the same amount of cash on the deal as they would be likely to get on a private sale.-</p>

				<p>These days, folk who want to change their car accept this and move on. It is quick and easy and, for the most part, safe. It is likely though that you could see the same car for sale at a higher price later on. That is what these companies do: they buy your car and sell it on.
On the other hand, the seller has cash in hand and then often use that as leverage when getting a good deal on their next car.
				</p>

			</div>

			<p>Most brands have dealers in most areas. It is an easy matter to drive along and use a car as part-exchange on a new or pre-loved motor. Just remember though that, again, the dealer will not give you the best price, although they will usually be keen to offer a good deal to get the sale
			</p>

				<h2>Auctions</h2>
				<p>Tricky business, auctions. If selling a car privately at auction the seller can ask for a minimum selling price or leave it to the discretion of the auction house. Reputable companies will always do their best to get their client a good price but remember that when it is sold, it is sold. There is no option for a change of mind if the achieved price does not suit.</p>

				<p>Purchasing a car at auction also requires a steady nerve and a competent knowledge of the pitfalls of buying in this way. Too many people get caught out by buying in haste. It is best to steer clear unless you really know what you are doing or have someone who does tag along. Two sets of eyes and ears are better than one. It pays to know the signs that signify a bad vehicle.r.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>It is the buyer's responsibility to make sure that the selected vehicle is in a sound and legal condition and in good working order. Auctions are a good way to get a great deal but take care.</p>
